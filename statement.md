# Problem statement

Manual bus seat booking is often time-consuming and prone to errors, such as double bookings or mismanagement of seat availability. Travelers and operators may face confusion and delays when handling bookings without an automated system. The Bus Reservation Simulator provides a simple, automated way to manage seat reservations efficiently, ensuring accuracy and saving time.

# Scope of the project

- The project simulates a basic bus seat reservation system.
  
- Users can view available seats, book seats, and cancel bookings.
  
- The system displays the current status of all seats to prevent double-booking.
  
- It is designed for learning programming basics, including loops, conditionals, arrays/lists, and user input.
  
- Can be enhanced in the future to include multiple buses, ticket pricing, date selection, and persistent storage.

  # Target users

  - Beginner programmers and students learning problem solving.

  - Small bus operators who need a simple seat management tool.
 
  - Users interested in understanding seat booking workflows without a complex system.
